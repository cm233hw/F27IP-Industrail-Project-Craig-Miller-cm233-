# F27IP-Industrail-Project-Craig-Miller-cm233-
HW Project

Repo contains screenshots of code snippets and in some cases actual files that pertain to code I have been involved in developing as my part of this industrial project.
This code will not work on its own as due to the sensitive business nature of the project much of the code cannot be released and the code that is present has been made generic with sensitive references removed.


# Repo contents:

On the top level a screenshot of the minimised overall project structure is included.
Project is split into a front and back-end folders.
Project was built as part of a team that also included Ryan West (rtw1) - as I primarily worked in the back-end of the codebase I have focused on my contributions there.
More detail on front-end will be demonstrated by colleague mentioned above. 

# Front-end
Front-end screenshots folder contains screenshots of dummy data in the deployed website to show the purpose/result of the codebase.

# Back-end
Back-end is split into two folders for two different aspects of back-end (one service written in node and one service written in java).
The reason for two different languages is simply that the team we were a part of was officially to let junior developers within the company learn as part of their own team so some development decisions (such as which language to build additional functionality in) were decided by what team members needed or wanted to learn for business purposes.
Screenshot showing tests passing also included.

# Java service
I contributed only sections of this service so only code relevant to my work is included (screenshot of code structure included for some context).
The code is fairly verbose so is hopefully followable - service runs 'scheduled task' periodically and 'repoMapper' and 'dependencies' code contain the functionality of the mapFilesToRepo function that was principally my own work.

# Node service
Node folder contains folder of code structure screenshots to provide context.
Also a folder of some unsensitive misc files such as tests, example readme, package.json and our linting rules of which I oversaw.
The remaining files are some code examples and screenshots of code that I either solely wrote or made significant contributions.
All code has had company references removed and made generic where needed.

It will be possible to show working demos if this is neccesary.
